"On the official Georgia COVID stats web page is this graph. Looks good, getting better, right? Look closer at the dates on the X-axis. They have arranged the dates out of order to create a declining appearance."

"In just 15 days the total number of #COVID19 cases in Georgia is up 49%, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at the state’s data visualization map of cases. The first map is July 2. The second is today. Do you see a 50% case increase? Can you spot how they’re hiding it?"

"After adjusting for potential confounders, for each g/day increase in consumption of head cabbage of the country, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreases by 13.6 %. For each g/day increase in consumption of cucumber, the mortality risk decreases by 15.7%. Consumption of lettuce and broccoli showed the opposite pattern, i.e. a higher consumption was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality. However, the results were more sensitive to adjustment, and the associations were no longer significant in some of the models."

"... this chart is extraordinary misleading.  If you don't believe me, ask \@AlbertoCairo who wrote the book on it. Check the scale on the two axes."
